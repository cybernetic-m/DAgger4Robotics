To run our code, you can upload on Google Colab the three notebooks:

1) "expert.ipynb" => You can retrain with Behavioral Cloning the expert policy
2) "reacher.ipynb" => You can retrain with DAgger the student policy on Reacher Environment
2) "kitchen.ipynb" => You can retrain with DAgger the student policy on Franka Kitchen Environment

We suggest you to read the README.md file on our Github Repository: https://github.com/cybernetic-m/DAgger4Robotics

There you can find directly three Google Colab buttons under the "Colab Instructions" section, and our Google Presentation under the "Presentation" section for more detail!
